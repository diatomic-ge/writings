Her footsteps pounded down the hallway, almost completely drowned out by the humming reverberating through the building, as the lights flickered through the windows.
She looked back over her shoulder as the shadows moved with the lights, hiding her fears as the distorted voice screeched at her panicked mind.
The floor shook as she stumbled, barely registering the sharp sound of shattering glass, or the crimson trail she left for the shadows that chased her.

She felt its claws dig into her calf when the lights disappeared, the incessant buzzing dulling as pain gnawed at her.
Screaming, she kicked, barely pulling her leg free, limping as the heat ran down to her bare feet.
Dry heaving, she felt along the wall through the blackness, begging her legs to work, the thing that was not a voice screaming as the walls shook, the claws clicking on the floor behind her.
She grabbed the doorknob, frantically pulling it open to the blinding lights, flashing in front of her.
The distorted voice screeched loudly, shaking her bones as she limped blindly towards salvation, before a small pop echoed through the cacophony of noises.
She stumbled and tripped to the hard concrete, her chest hot and wet as she struggled to see.

The shadow behind her slipped into the night.
